\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item statistical data protection has a long history because it is important
\item must focus on rigorous privacy guarantees
\item accessing the database should reveal nothing about any individual in it. need to serperate the utility of a database from the increased risk of hard due to joining the database 
\item this can be achived with low distortion
\item the key idea is to randomize responses so as to effectively hide the presence or absence of any individual over the course of the life time of the database 
\item what does it mean to preserve privacy and how and it be accomplished 
\section*{how hard is hard}
\item lets think about common approaches and there short comings
\subsection*{large query set}
\item one idea is to prevent user from making queries about specific individuals
\item should not be able to search on users at all. 
\subsection*{query auditing}
\item each query to a database is evaluated in the context of the query history to determine if the response would discos information if so then refuse the query
\item this is bad because it is computationally infeasible and the fact a query wont be discoed its gives information 
\subsection*{sub sampling }
\item can only query from a randomized subset of individuals 
\item but this is not secure for those who appear in a subsample 
\subsection*{input perturbation }
\item either the data or the queries are modefied before the repone is given 
\item randomized response flip a coin if it is heads always respond negativly if it is true respond truthly half the time 
\item this does not work well for complex data 
\subsection*{adding radnom noise to the output}
\item will fail if done naievly 
\item if the noise is added at the output and is mean zero can repeate a query adn average to get an aproximate true value 
\subsection*{non private database}
\item a system is blatantly non private if an adversary can constrct a canadite databse that agrees with teh real database D in some large proprtion of enteries by querying our system 
\item if noise is bounded by some uppper bound e (that is a response cal only be e away from the truth ) than an adversary can reconstruct the database within 4 E positions of the true values 
\item bounded noise can be defeated by some number of queries 
\item so need to bound the number of quries 
\subsection*{what is hard }
\item linkage attack released data linked with auxilarray data to capture ifomratoion about the responsests other than what is released from the database 
\item need to take into account auxilarray information
\item anything that can be learned about an indivuadl from a statistcal database should be learnable with out acess to it 
\subsection*{Differential Privacy}
\item DP ensures that the ability of an adversary to inflect harm (or good) to any set of people should be teh same indepednt of wheter a person is in the dataset 
\item consider two data bases $D, D'$ which differ by only one row  
\item a function $K$ is $\epsilon$- Differential private if $\forall (D,D')$ and all $S\subseteq rank(K)$ $$P(K(D)\in S)\leq e^{\epsilon}P(K(D')\in S)$$
\item this holds travially for anyone not in the dataset 
\item if any one particpant were to be added to the database under this regine no output would become more or less liekely 
\subsection*{achiving DP}
\item for a function f the $\ell_1$ sensativity of f is gvien by  $$\delta f =max_{D,D'}||f(D)-F(D')||_{1}$$
\item that is the sensativity is the max l1 difrent between the function with or without any one perosn 
\item with leplacian noise we have highest density at zero, and for any $z,z':|z-z'|/leq 1$ the density is at most $e^{\epsilon}$
\item also symetric about zero 
\item can be expanded ot more dimesnions 
\item need to add leplacian noise to each query even if the queries are chosen adaotily wih each sucessive queiry dpedont on the dprevious awnser this will work
\item our expected error is the same regardless of the size of teh dataset 
\item i think the rest is kinda in the weeds
\item 
\end{itemize}

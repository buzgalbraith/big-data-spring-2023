\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item a table in a relational database must have exactly one index 
    \item that is false there are foreign keys 
    \item each table in a relational database must have a primary key 
    \item this is false  ( i am not sure the purpose of not having a primary key but that is something you can do)
    \item in a relational data base a primary key value must be unique across all tables in the database 
    \item i think false, just has to be true when you join like one user can have multiple songs they like in recommender systems

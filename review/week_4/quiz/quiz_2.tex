\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\subsection*{question 1 }
    \item a split in map reduce can either be smaller or larger than an hdfs block 
    \item a split in map reduce is pretty much just file size over number of mappers so it is dependent on input file size
    \subsection*{quesiton 2}
    \item Combiners in map-reduce improve efficiency by decreasing the number of intermediate keys prior to the reduce phase.
    \item \textcolor{blue}{false} Combiners reduce the number of key value pairs not the number of keys 
    \subsection*{question 3:}
    \item the replication factor of an HDFS file can be modified after the file is created
    \item \textcolor{blue}{true} hdfs does not care if you change the replication size it would just have to create or dellete replicated block data 
    \item  
    \subsection*{question 4 }
    \item the data nodes in hdfs are responsible for file name and location data
    \item \textcolor{blue}{false} that is what the name nodes document
    \subsection*{question 5 }
    \item question 5 is cursed i'm going to skip for now. it is like writing  the psudo code for a map reduce function 
\end{itemize}

\section{abstract }
\begin{itemize}
\item dask enables parallel and out of core computation. 
\item we couple vlocked algorirhsm wirh memory awate task scheudling to achive a parallel out of core Numpy clone 
\item this scales to modern hardware and large datasets 
\section*{Introduction}
\item sci py stuff does not use parallel implementations 
\item we want to parallelize the scipy code with out needing a full re-write
\item dask encodes parallel algorithms using python primitives, and has hte dask.array type a parallel n dimensional array that copies numpy's interface
\subsection*{modern hardware}
\item hardware has changed a lot in recent years 
\item most modern cpu's have multiple threads, most modern storage is on an ssd which makes reading information from disk much faster and thus more practice
\item these advancements make single machine implementations rival small cluster computation while keeping the ease of working with a single machine 
\subsection*{dask graphs}
\item dask encodes parallel computation in a way that requires low amount of instruction by the developer
\item a dask graph is a python dictionary mapping keys or tasks to values 
\item storing programs in graphs allows for easy task scheduling 
\subsection*{specification }
\item represent computation as a DAG of tasks with data dependincies 
\item a task is a tuple with  a callable first ellement 
\item tasks are automic unfits of work that can be run by a single worker
\item an argument may be either a key present in the dask, a literal, another task,, or a list of arguments
\subsection*{dask arrays}
\item the dask array submodule uses dask graphs to crete a numpy like libary that uses all cores and works on datasets not fully in memoery 
\item dask doe sthis in ga genreal way 
\subsection*{blocking algorithms}
\item blocked algorithms compute a large result with may small computations, 
\item dask is built on blocked algorirms that is breaking operations into many small chunks 
\item can execute all parts of a graph with the .compute method 
\subsection*{array metadata }
\item dask array objects have the following information
\begin{enumerate}
    \item a dask graph 
    \item infomration aout shape and chunk shape 
    \item a name 
    \item a data tpye 
\end{enumerate}
\item a dask array needs to know the size of all internal chunks which can be ragged
\item can slice dask arrays by chunks 
\subsection*{capatbilties and limitations}
\item dask works on most numpy functions, but does not work with functions whose output shape can not be determined head of time like where statments 
\subsection*{dynamic task scheduling}
\item dask has dynamic task scheduling
\item more or less when a worker completes a task, the runtime state is updated, and a new task is chosed from among the set of ready to run tasks 
\item dask does not push intermeidate results to disk like map reduce does
\item they use lifo task execution
\item user can also modify the scheudler for there task if they so desire 
\item there are also numerous scheudlers including single machine, multi thread multi process and distributed 
\item then they talk about some benchmarking 
\section*{other collections}
\item the dask libary containes parallel collections other than dask.array including dask.bag and dask.dataframe 
\subsection*{bag}
\item a bag is an unorderd colleciton with repeates. 
\item is really good for initial data cleaning because it uses proefmance form other well estbalished tools and adds pararllism 

\subsection*{data frame}
\item the dask data frame module implements a large datafrmame out of many pandas datafames. 
\item the interface is bassed off of pandas
\item daa frames are powerfull but can not achive the same parallel preformance as arrays or bags 
\item data frames can efficently do computation on partioned data sets as well as allong axis if they are in the same block 
\item dask data frames are helpfull as they let users easily acess datasets that are larger than memory using the pandas interface
\subsection*{dask for general computation}
\item daks can work well with sopisticaed parallel algorirhsm on multi core machines 
\item 
\end{itemize}
